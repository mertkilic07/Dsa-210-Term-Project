# ðŸ“Š **Understanding Bitcoin Price Movements Through Behavioral Data**

## ðŸ§© **1. Project Overview**

This project aims to examine the relationship between **behavioral factors** and **Bitcoinâ€™s short-term price direction**.  
Specifically, it investigates whether indicators such as **social media activity**, **public attention**, and **investor psychology** can help explain or predict Bitcoinâ€™s daily price changes.  

To explore this relationship, the project integrates multiple datasets capturing different behavioral dimensions â€” including **tweet activity and sentiment**, **Google Trends web and YouTube search interest**, and the **Crypto Fear & Greed Index** â€” alongside Bitcoin price data.  
The analysis focuses on identifying whether patterns in collective investor sentiment and public engagement correspond to measurable movements in Bitcoinâ€™s market behavior.
