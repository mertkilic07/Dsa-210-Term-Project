# 📊 **Understanding Bitcoin Price Movements Through Behavioral Data**

## 🧩 **1. Project Overview**
The cryptocurrency market operates heavily on **investor behavior and collective sentiment** rather than intrinsic value.  
This project aims to explore how **behavioral and attention-based factors** — such as social media activity, public attention, and investor psychology — influence **Bitcoin’s short-term price direction**.

By analyzing multiple behavioral datasets, including:
- Bitcoin-related tweets that  (social media activity and sentiment)
- Google Trends search interest for “bitcoin” and “crypto” (public attention)
- The Crypto Fear & Greed Index (investor psychology)

the study seeks to uncover measurable relationships between **collective investor sentiment** and **market reactions**.

Bitcoin is chosen as the focal asset due to its **dominant role in the cryptocurrency market** and its ability to **represent overall crypto market behavior**.  
Through this analysis, the project aims to determine whether behavioral signals can help explain or even anticipate **Bitcoin’s daily price changes**.
